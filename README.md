Data Bindinng:
three types-
1.one way-component to template
2.one way- template to component
3.two way- component to template & vice versa

INTERPOLATION:Interpolation is one way of data binding that is used to transfer data from TS code to HTML template.
It uses curly braces,inside which the property/expression is written.


PROPERTY BINDING: Property Binding is also one-way data binding technique.
we bind property of DOM element to a field which is a defined proprty in our component TS code

ATTRIBUTE BINDING is required in those cases when HTML attribute has no corresponding DOM property
HTML attribute value contains initial value whereas DOM property value contains current value
